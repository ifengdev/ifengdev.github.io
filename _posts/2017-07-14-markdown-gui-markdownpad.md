### Make it your own 

Fonts, color schemes, layouts and stylesheets are all 100% customizable so you can turn MarkdownPad into your perfect editor.

### A robust editor for advanced Markdown users 

MarkdownPad supports multiple Markdown processing engines, including standard Markdown, Markdown Extra (with Table support) and GitHub Flavored Markdown.

With a tabbed document interface, PDF export, a built-in image uploader, session management, spell check, auto-save, syntax highlighting and a built-in CSS management interface, there's no limit to what you can do with MarkdownPad.

Jekyll offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
